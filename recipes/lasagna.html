    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>Lasagna is a wide, flat sheet of pasta. Lasagna can refer to either the type of noodle or to the typical lasagna dish which is a dish made with several layers of lasagna sheets with sauce and other ingredients, such as meats and cheese, in between the lasagna noodles.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1½ pounds lean ground beef</li>
        <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh basil</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons brown sugar</li>
        <li>1½ teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>1 (29 ounce) can diced tomatoes</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a skillet over medium heat, brown ground beef, onion and garlic for 5 minutes; drain fat. Mix in basil, oregano, brown sugar, 1 1/2 teaspoons salt, diced tomatoes and tomato paste. Simmer for 30 to 45 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add lasagna noodles, and cook for 5 to 8 minutes, or until al dente; drain. Lay noodles flat on towels, and blot dry.</li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, mix together eggs, ricotta, Parmesan cheese, parsley and 1 teaspoon salt.</li>
        <li>Layer 1/3 of the lasagna noodles in the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish. Cover noodles with 1/2 ricotta mixture, 1/2 of the mozzarella cheese and 1/3 of the sauce. Repeat. Top with remaining noodles and sauce. Sprinkle additional Parmesan cheese over the top.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven 30 minutes. Let stand 10 minutes before serving.</li>
